# TruckIt

## Description
TruckIt is a project aimed at analyzing the operations of trucking companies based on photos of trucks using text recognition. The primary goal is to determine which companies frequently operate in specific locations.

## Folder Structure

### Database
- Contains a file with SQL create commands for setting up the database.

### API
- Includes an ASP.NET Core API for handling data. Note: Some IP addresses still need to be updated in this section.

## How It Works

### Image Analysis
- Photos of trucks are processed using text recognition algorithms to extract relevant information.

### Data Storage
- Extracted data is stored in a database to facilitate easy retrieval and analysis.

### API
- The ASP.NET Core API serves as the interface for accessing and querying the stored data.

## Usage

1. Execute the SQL create commands in the 'database' folder to set up the required database.
2. Update the necessary IP addresses in the 'api' folder for the ASP.NET Core API.

**Note:**
Ensure proper handling of sensitive information, especially IP addresses, to maintain system security.
